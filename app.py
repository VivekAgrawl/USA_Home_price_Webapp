        ### Key Insights
            
        ##### Population (Importance: 28.64%)

        Population emerges as the most influential factor, contributing significantly to the predictive power of the model. Changes in population dynamics evidently play a crucial role in determining home prices.
            
        ##### PPI (Cement) and PPI (Concrete)

        Producer Price Indices for Cement and Concrete hold substantial importance, collectively contributing 39.72% to the model's accuracy. This emphasizes the impact of construction material prices on home prices.
                     
        ##### Unemployment and Economic Indicators

        Unemployment, Personal Income, and GDP collectively contribute 29.49% to the model's accuracy. The model recognizes the importance of labor market dynamics and broader economic indicators in predicting home prices.
                     
        ##### Other Factors

        Employees in Construction, Labor Force, Houses Supply, Federal Funds, and Median CPI, while less influential individually, still contribute to the overall accuracy of the model.

            ### Project Overview
            Investigate the factors influencing US home prices over the last two decades through a data-driven analysis. Utilizing datasets from [fred.stlouisfed.org](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), key factors are considered to understand their impact on the S&P Case Schiller Home Price Index.
            
             ### Key Factors
            Population, Producer Price Index (Cement & Concrete, Bricks), Unemployment Rate, Personal Income, GDP, Construction Employment, Labor Force Participation Rate, Monthly Supply of New Houses, Federal Funds Effective Rate, and Median Consumer Price Index.
            
             ### Data Science Model
            Using advanced analytics, our model uncovers patterns and relationships, shedding light on how these factors impact home prices.
            
             ### Why It Matters
            For homeowners, buyers, policymakers, and investors, this analysis offers valuable insights into the forces driving real estate dynamics. Explore our web app for interactive visualizations and detailed analyses. Uncover the story behind the numbers, empowering informed decisions in the ever-evolving US housing landscape.
